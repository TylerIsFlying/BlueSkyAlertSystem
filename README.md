For the program to work you will need to make a blue sky account on https://bsky.app/

After making the blue sky account you will enter your user name for the account and password for the account in a .env file.

Inside the .env file it should be for example: 

CLIENT_USERNAME=test.bsky.social

CLIENT_PASSWORD=somepasswordhere123

Currently still in development and working on it.
